        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I am a fun, life-loving mom and wife. I love to spend my free time adventuring with my two little girls and
          husband. We love to travel, and I plan to put as many checks on my bucket list as I can! I am as girly as it
          gets and love all things pink or sparkly. When I am not traveling, I spend my time either doing aerial
          fitness, or coding. I started at a young age doing circus classes (trapeze, ballet, gymnastics, lyra- you name
          it!), and continue to take aerial classes (mostly pole and silks these days). Aerial work keep me physically
          in shape, and coding keeps me mentally sharp. My interests wrap up the best of both in neat little bow!</p>
        <p>I started working towards a career in development because it so greatly combines my strengths and niches. I
          am able to be incredibly creative and showcase my keen eye for style and design. I am also very organized and
          a bit of a self-proclaimed perfectionist, so that only benefits me when laying out code. I enjoy all types of
          technology and always try to stay up on the latest and greatest. The best part of working in development is
          the ability to work remotely. There is nothing more enjoyable than doing your work surrounded by what you
          love- whether that be nature, or the comfort of your own home! I look forward to constantly learning new
          development tricks and putting them to use. Technology is ever changing and there is no limit to where it may
          take us, so I plan to learn all that I can and explore it to the fullest!!</p>
